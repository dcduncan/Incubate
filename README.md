# Incubate

Do you have issues with impulse shopping?
Do you make rash decisions on too short of notice?

Why not __Incubate__ your idea for a little while and see if it still seems like a good idea tomorrow? Next week? Or the end of the month?

__Incubate__ is a simple (work in progress) messenger bot that can assist you with these matters. Just ask it to incubate an idea for awhile and it'll contact you later for you to decide what you think about it.

Built using AWS lambda, Facebook Messenger, Kotlin and we'll see what comes next.

Also note: most items are singletons purely for performance reasons (albeit premature optimizing) but I'd rather pay less for Lambda than more so...
